        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>When you replace butter and eggs with ground walnuts, and all-purpose flour             with a blend of oat flour and oatmeal, you get a moist, chewy, vegan cookie
        that’s loaded with good-for-your-heart ingredients.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Tbs. canola oil</li>
            <li>2 cups walnuts</li>
            <li>1 cup light brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
            <li>11/2 cups oat flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp. baking soda</li>
            <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 cups rolled oats</li>
            <li>3 3.5-oz. bars bittersweet vegan chocolate, chopped, or 11/2 cups vegan chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Coat 2 baking sheets with cooking spray, or line with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Blend walnuts in food processor 30 seconds, or until ground into a fine meal. Add canola oil, and blend 2 to 3 minutes more, or until mixture has the consistency of natural peanut butter, scraping down sides of food processor occasionally. Transfer to bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk together brown sugar and ½ cup water in small saucepan, and bring mixture to a boil. Pour brown sugar mixture over ground walnut butter, add vanilla extract, and stir until no lumps remain.</li>
            <li>Whisk together oat flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in separate bowl. Stir oat flour mixture into walnut mixture. Cool 10 minutes. Fold in oats, then chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Shape cookie dough into 2-inch balls, and place 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Flatten cookies with bottom of drinking glass dipped in water. Bake 8 to 10 minutes, or until cookies begin to brown and tops look dry. Cool 3 minutes on baking sheets, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
